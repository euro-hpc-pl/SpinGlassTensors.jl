# SpinGlassTensors.jl
Part of SpinGlassPEPS package. It constitutes the basis for the preparation of tensors and operations on them.

We don't expect the user to interact with this package, as it is more of a "back-end" type. Nevertheless, we provide API references should the need arise.

 **_IMPORTANT:_** 

Currently, this package supports Julia version 1.10 only
